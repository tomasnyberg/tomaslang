## The basics
- [X] basic data types (number, string, bool, null)
- [X] arithmetic (+, -, *, /) and parentheses
- [X] integer division with /_
- [X] print statement
- [X] local variables
- [X] global variables (they kind of suck though)
- [X] Comparisons (e.g. >, !=, ==)
- [X] logical operators (and, or)

## Can't live without it
- [X] blocks (with { })
- [X] control flow (if, else if)
- [X] Loops (for, while)
- [X] functions (with return values and params)
- [X] Arrays
- [ ] Hashmaps / Sets
- [ ] I/O with outside world, e.g. read file/stdin

## Don't want to live without it
- [X] constant variables
- [X] break / continue
- [X] Nested functions
- [ ] Lambdas (preferrably JavaSript-like ones)
- [ ] Ternary
- [ ] Rust-like match
- [ ] Multiline strings

## Syntax sugar
- [x] Rust-like iterators, e.g. `for i in 1..5 {}`
- [x] Haskell-like list generation, e.g. `[1..5]`
- [X] compound assignment (e.g. `+=`, `*=`)
- [X] Python-like list generation, e.g. `[True]*100`
- [ ] Haskell-like list transformations (e.g. `map (+5) [1,2,3,4,5]`)
- [ ] Python-like list comprehensions, e.g. `[x*5 for x in xs]`

## Syntax sugar (sweetness++)
- [ ] Python-like @cache
- [ ] Go-like defer()
- [ ] @parallel (??!?)
