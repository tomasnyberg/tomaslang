## The basics
- [X] basic data types (number, string, bool, null)
- [X] arithmetic (+, -, *, /) and parentheses
- [X] integer division with /_
- [X] print statement
- [X] local variables
- [X] global variables (they kind of suck though)
- [X] Comparisons (e.g. >, !=, ==)
- [X] logical operators (and, or)
- [X] length of collections with len()

## Can't live without it
- [X] blocks (with { })
- [X] control flow (if, else if)
- [X] Loops (for, while)
- [X] functions (with return values and params)
- [X] Arrays
- [X] Hashmaps / Sets
- [X] Python-like 'in' operator (arrays, strings, hashmaps)
- [X] I/O with outside world, e.g. read file/stdin

## Don't want to live without it
- [X] constant variables
- [X] break / continue
- [X] Nested functions
- [X] Lambdas (preferably JavaScript-like ones)
- [X] Ternary
- [X] Rust-like match
- [X] any/all (Python-like)
- [ ] Collection iteration (e.g. for x in xs)
- [ ] Multiline strings

## Syntax sugar
- [x] Rust-like iterators, e.g. `for i in 1..5 {}`
- [x] Haskell-like list generation, e.g. `[1..5]`
- [X] compound assignment, e.g. `+=`, `*=`
- [X] Python-like list generation, e.g. `[True]*100`
- [ ] Haskell-like list transformations, e.g. `map (+5) [1,2,3,4,5]`
  - [X] map
  - [X] filter
  - [X] words
  - [ ] reduce
  - [ ] take
  - [ ] drop
  - [ ] takeWhile
  - [ ] dropWhile
  - [ ] max/min
- [ ] Python-like list comprehensions, e.g. `[x*5 for x in xs]`

## Syntax sugar (sweetness++)
- [ ] Python-like @cache
- [ ] Go-like defer()
- [ ] @parallel (??!?)
