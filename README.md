## Cigg
_A blazing~~ly fast~~ language_ ğŸš¬ğŸš¬
____

Cigg is a stack-based bytecode VM interpreter written from scratch, by me, using Rust. The language is inspired by the _clox_ implementation from [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)
(amazing book, you should buy it and read it). Cigg borrows some key ideas from clox, such as its Pratt parser, but strives to be its own distinct language, with distinct
ideas, syntax, and features.
